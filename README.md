This repository was uploaded as part of a project while completing this tutorial:
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/

It demonstrates a serverless lambda function-based architecture and automatic instance updating when anything is pushed to this github repository.

I did not create the content of this repository, but you can visit the finished product of the tutorial here:
